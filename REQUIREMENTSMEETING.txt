REQUIREMENTS MEETING: LIST PRIORITY
Do you want an app or website?
Who is the audience? (Students)... They are not only possibly getting matched to Gwinnett Medical center but other hospitals as well??
All hospitals in America or only those in Georgia??
What qualifies as most likely to be accepted in? What is most important? List in priority or all equally important.
What, in your eyes, would make for a very effecient website?
Must they apply to the program prior to having the option to contact the hospital?
How should they contact the hospitals they're matched with, email or phone? Or will they submit their information and someone contact them?
Would it be ideal to have a name of the person they must be in contact with displayed?

We are thinking: a website/app with blank input boxes present on the page, they must enter their values and press 'Go'. The new page that appears will have a list
of hospitals. When they hover over the hospital name, 
a brief small window will appear that lists: the name, small photo, requirements
When the hospital is clicked, there will be 
a new page with: name, address, contact number, contact email, small photo, requirements, button to directly apply.
